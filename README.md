## 1. Overview

**The Sorting Algorithm** is a high-stress, single-subject simulation designed to test and calibrate an operative's core cognitive and emotional faculties. The subject ("Charlize") is placed within a series of three puzzle chambers, each designed to attack a different aspect of her psyche, all while under the direct observation and chaotic influence of her handler ("The Governess").

The primary objective is not merely to solve the puzzles, but to endure the psychological pressure and demonstrate personal growth, measured by the simulation's **Sparks** system.

## 2. Core Concepts

This simulation is built on three pedagogical pillars, inspired by the "Mistress of Mystery" training protocols:

* **Intellectual Acuity:** The ability to discern truth from sophisticated misinformation, focusing on historical context over surface-level data.
* **Physical & Mental Discipline:** The ability to perform complex motor tasks while under direct psychological assault from distracting or emotionally compromising data streams.
* **Self-Acceptance:** The ultimate test, requiring the subject to confront and integrate her own perceived flaws rather than attempting to fight or destroy them.

## 3. Simulation Modules (Chambers)

* **Chamber 1: The Archive:** A test of observational analysis. The subject must identify a single thematically anachronistic document from a library of forgeries.
* **Chamber 2: The Gauntlet:** A test of cognitive endurance. The subject must perform a continuous motor-skill balancing act while being subjected to a "Vigilance Check"â€”a stream of distracting text and intermittent reading comprehension quizzes.
* **Chamber 3: The Mirror:** A test of the self. The subject must face a reflection that vocalizes her deepest insecurities. The only solution is an act of radical self-acceptance.
